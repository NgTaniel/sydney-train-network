      <p>This is considered to be the ðŸ§¡ Heart ðŸ§¡ of the network, so if there are issues across Central or anywhere across the City and general CBD areas, you know there ought to be problems!!</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Altogether in this bustling station and interchange, there are a total of 22 operational platforms as of 2023.</p>

    <div className='formers'>
      <p>Platforms 13 - 15 used to host the intercity services but have been decommissioned to accomodate for the Sydney Metro Line project expansion. It is likely that platform 15 will no longer exist for the foreseeable future.</p>
